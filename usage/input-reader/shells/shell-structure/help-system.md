# Help System

The help system is what every shell uses, invoked by the unified `help` command available for every type of shell. The function responsible for showing help entries or command usage and some extra help is `HelpSystem.ShowHelp()` in the `Terminaux.Shell.Commands` namespace. Explore with us the mechanics of the help system below.

## General help

When the user requests the `help` command in any shell, the above function gets called, querying the current shell type (`Shell.CurrentShellType`) as discussed previously.

The function gets all the commands, including the unified ones, from the command type, but hides all the hidden commands (commands that are flagged with the `CommandFlags.Hidden` flag). It also takes care of the modded and aliased commands.

The help system then prints the list of commands to the console.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of the shells implement too many commands, potentially requiring you to either wrap its output using the `wrap` command, or turn on the simplified help using the `-simplified` switch.
{% endhint %}

## Command help

If the user specified a command when calling the `help` command, the help system extracts the help definition and all the command usages.

It extracts from these values found in the `CommandInfo` class:

* `HelpDefinition`: The brief summary of what the command does
* `CommandArgumentInfo`: The command argument info that supplies the below information:
  * `.Arguments`: Defines the command arguments
  * `.Switches`: Defines the command switches
  * `.RenderedUsage`: Defines the rendered usage to be printed for a command

The rendered usage has the following characteristics:

* For required switches, they're surrounded with the `<` and the `>` marks. Switches that are not required are surrounded with the `[` and the `]` marks instead.
* Switches that require values don't have the `[` and the `]` marks surrounding the `=value` part, indicating that the switch needs a value.
* For required arguments, they're surrounded with the `<` and the `>` marks. Arguments that are not required are surrounded with the `[` and the `]` marks instead.
* For numeric arguments, a marker is shown indicating that it only accepts numbers.
* For switches that conflict, they're put in a group, such as `[-switch1|-switch2]`.
