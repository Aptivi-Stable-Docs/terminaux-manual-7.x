# Color Wheel

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (86).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The new color wheel, `ColorSelector`, is now available. You can use this brand new color selector, which is powered by the [textual UI](../../console-tools/textual-ui/) feature, to get information about your selected color visually. The color preview is split into two views: normal and color blinded. You can call the `OpenColorSelector()` function in your code to get the new color selector.

The color selector allows you to change the color in the following modes:

* In true color mode, you can change the hue, the lighting, and the saturation by pressing the appropriate key shortcuts to change the colors.
* In 256 and 16 colors mode, you can select a color using the right and the left arrow keys. It shows you color information, including the CMYK, HSL, and grayscale values.

The following controls are available:

| Key                                             | Action                                                                         |
