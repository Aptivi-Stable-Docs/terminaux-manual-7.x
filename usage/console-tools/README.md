# Console Tools

Terminaux was created to provide you various console tools that are useful for your interactive .NET console applications, such as those that simulate the textual user interface (TUI) for various interactive applications, such as Nitrocid KS, BassBoom, and GRILO.

Terminaux provides you with a plethora of console tools, such as a console wrapper, a powerful console writer with various types of writing, and basic terminal graphics renderer. Here are some of its tools:

{% content-ref url="textual-ui/interactive-tui.md" %}
[interactive-tui.md](textual-ui/interactive-tui.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="console-writers/" %}
[console-writers](console-writers/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="console-checker/" %}
[console-checker](console-checker/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="console-wrapper.md" %}
[console-wrapper.md](console-wrapper.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Other tools can be found in the left side pane of the documentation.
