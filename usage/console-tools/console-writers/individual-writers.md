# Individual Writers

## Standard console writers

The standard console writers provide you with non-moving parts of the text. They have their own writers and renderers to allow you to use them in two ways. The writer writes directly to the console, while the renderers are more suitable for the screen feature that you can check out at:

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Normal console writers

Starting from `ConsoleWriters`, this namespace provides the following classes:

* `ListEntryWriterColor`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to let you write a list entry to the console easily.
* `ListWriterColor`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to let you write the list entries to the console easily. It supports both non-generic and generic enumerables and dictionaries.
* `TextWriterRaw`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to allow you to write the raw text to the console either to the standard output or the standard error.
* `TextWriterColor`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to allow you to write the text to the console with and without color.
* `TextWriterHighlightedColor`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to allow you to write the highlighted text to the console with and without color.
  * By default, the modern way of highlighting specific text is enabled by using a VT sequence intended to reverse the colors. If you still want to use the legacy way, you'll have to set the `legacy` argument to `true` before passing in all the usual parameters.
* `TextWriterWhereColor`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to write the text in a specific position to the console with and without color.
* `TextWriterSlowColor`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to simulate a typewriter writing a requested string to the console with and without color.
* `TextWriterWhereSlowColor`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to simulate a typewriter that writes a text in a specific position to the console with and without color.
* `WrappedWriter`
  * Provides you with the necessary functions to write long text to the console, with a basic UI that allows you to skim through the text. Consult [this page](../../input-reader/other-input/editors-and-viewers.md) for more info.

Consult the below page to find out how to use these functions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The console writers have three variants of writing functions:

* `Write()`: Default colors
* `WriteColor()`: Foreground colors
* `WriteColorBack()`: Foreground and background colors
{% endhint %}

#### List entry writer (`ListEntryWriterColor`)

This writer allows you to easily write one list entry with its value to the console without having to use two different functions or a long function call for writing this entry. This is internally used by the ListWriterColor writer, which is shown below.

#### List writer (`ListWriterColor`)

This writer allows you to easily write list entries from either an array or an enumerable, such as lists and dictionaries, to the console without having to write loop statements. This is available in both the generic and the non-generic versions.

#### Normal text writer (`TextWriterColor`)

This writer is the simplest writer with color support, and can be used to write general text to the console effortlessly.

#### Highlighted text writer (`TextWriterHighlightedColor`)

This writer takes the colors and reverts the background and the foreground colors to make text look like as if it's highlighted.

#### Raw text writer (`TextWriterRaw`)

This writer provides access to plain console writers and raw console writers that allow you to write text plainly. As for the raw console writing function, it's found in the same class that you can use to print raw text to the console, including escape sequences.

#### Positional text writer (`TextWriterWhereColor`)

This text writer allows you to write text at any position to the console. This moves the cursor to the destination, writes text to the console, and, if instructed, to return to the original position that the cursor was on before the writing process.

## Customization

Some of the console writers allow customization, such as the bordered boxes or progress bars.

### Borders

You can customize the borders for some of the console writers that support borders by editing properties found in the global settings of the borders, which can be found in the `BorderSettings.GlobalSettings` property. You can pass your own instance of `BorderSettings` with your own customizations to the border and its properties to the supported writers and all the informational boxes. The following writers support editing the border settings:

* `BorderColor`
* `BorderTextColor`
* `BoxFrameColor`
* `ProgressBarColor`
* `ProgressBarVerticalColor`
* `SliderColor`
* `SliderVerticalColor`
* ...and much more

{% hint style="info" %}
Pre-defined borders can be accessed by calling one of the following properties in the `PredefinedBorders` class:

* `Default`
* `RectangleTwoLines`
* `RectangleTwoLinesEdge`
* `RectangleThin`
* `RectangleThick`
* `RectangleThickEdge`
* `RectangleSimple`
* `HorizontalIntersection`
* `VerticalIntersection`
* `Intersections`
* `HorizontalIntersectionThick`
* `VerticalIntersectionThick`
* `IntersectionsThick`
* `HorizontalIntersectionDouble`
* `VerticalIntersectionDouble`
* `IntersectionsDouble`
{% endhint %}

### Wrapped pager controls

The below wrapped pager controls are available when wrapping is enabled:

* `ESC`: Exits the pager
* `Page Up`: Moves the output by one page backward, but stops at the beginning of the output.
* `Page Down`: Moves the output by one page forward, but stops at the end of the output.
* `Up Arrow`: Moves up by one line
* `Down Arrow`: Moves down by one line
* `Home`: Goes to the first page
* `End`: Goes to the last page
* `Any key`: Moves the output by one page forward and exits if it reaches end of line
